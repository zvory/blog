I'm currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. In this coming winter, I will be working at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

In the summer, I worked as a backend developer (Ruby on Rails, PostgresQL, AWS, lots of DevOps-y stuff) on the Platform and Scalability team at [Influitive](https://influitive.com/). I did a lot of cool stuff there and learned a lot.

Before Influitive, I was a Frontend JS developer at [Rangle.io](https://rangle.io/). I worked heavily with Angular 4, Redux, RxJs/Observables, and TypeScript. I've experimented with React, and found that I quite like it.

Before that I worked at [Kik Interactive](http://www.kik.com) as a QA and Release Engineer. My first co-op was at [LEAGUE](http://league.com) as a Test Automation Engineer.

I like fitness, technology, helping people, and building deep empathetic connections.
